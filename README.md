# RIC System for Amboy's Food Stall

Project is divided by two folders:
[client] - Front-end
[server] - Back-end

## Available Scripts

You have to run both client and server

For front-end use **must access the client folder**:

### `npm start` 

For back-end use **must access the server folder**:

### `nodemon`

Front-end runs at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
Back-end runs at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

You don't have to open the localhost of back-end since it is connected in front-end

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

In AppBar component I used *position="fixed"*. You can use *position="sticky"* but it does not work
on IE11 (you don't use that right?)
